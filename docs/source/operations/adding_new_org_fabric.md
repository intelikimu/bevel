# Adding new organization to existing network in Hyperledger Fabric

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Modifying configuration file](#create_config_file)
- [Running playbook to deploy Hyperledger Fabric network](#run_network)


<a name = "prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites
To add a new organization a fully configured Fabric network must be present already, i.e. a Fabric network which has Orderers, Peers, Channels (with all Peers already in the channels). The corresponding crypto materials should also be present in their respective Hashicorp Vault. Addition of a new organization has been tested on an existing network which is created by BAF. Networks created using other methods may be suitable but this has not been tested by BAF team.


<a name = "create_config_file"></a>
## Modifying Configuration File

While modifying the `network.yaml` for the adding new organization, all the existing organizations should have `org_status` tag as `existing` and the new organization should have `org_status` tag as `new` under `network.channels` as 

    network:
      channels:
      - channel:
        ..
        ..
        participants:
        - organization:
          ..
          ..
          org_status: new  #org_status can be new/existing

and under `network.organizations` as

    network:
      organizations:
        - organization:
          ..
          ..
          org_status: new  #org_status can be new/existing

The `network.yaml` file should contain the specific `network.organization` patch along with the orderer information.


For reference, sample `network_neworg.yaml` file looks like below (but always check the latest at `platforms/hyperledger-fabric/configuration/samples`):

## Run playbook to add the new organization to the existing Hyperledger Fabric network

The [add-organization.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-automation-framework/tree/master/platforms/hyperledger-fabric/configuration/add-organization.yaml) playbook is used to add a new organization to the existing network. This can be done using the following command

```
ansible-playbook platforms/hyperledger-fabric/configuration/add-organization.yaml --extra-vars "@path-to-network.yaml"
```

---
**NOTE:** Make sure that the `org_status` label was set as `new` when the network is deployed for the first time.

---

---
**NOTE:** If you have additional applications, please deploy them as well.
